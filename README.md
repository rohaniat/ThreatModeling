# SpendSmart Application Threat Modeling

This repository contains a threat model report for the SpendSmart personal finance application developed by Spendology Solutions. The analysis uses the STRIDE framework to categorize and analyze potential security threats, with proposed mitigations to address each identified threat.

## Files in this Repository

- **ThreatModelingReport.pdf**: A comprehensive report detailing identified threats, vulnerabilities, and mitigations using the STRIDE framework.

## Project Overview

### 1. Executive Summary
The report provides a summary of identified security threats, such as identity spoofing, data tampering, and denial of service, and offers recommendations to improve SpendSmart's security posture.

### 2. Threat Categories (STRIDE)

#### Spoofing Identity
- **Threat**: Attackers spoof user identities to gain unauthorized access.
- **Mitigation**: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) and strong password policies.

#### Tampering with Data
- **Threat**: Data may be intercepted and altered during transmission.
- **Mitigation**: Enforce end-to-end encryption with TLS 1.3 for secure data transit.

#### Repudiation
- **Threat**: Users may deny performing certain actions.
- **Mitigation**: Use non-repudiation mechanisms such as digital signatures for financial transactions.

#### Information Disclosure
- **Threat**: Exposure of sensitive financial data to unauthorized parties.
- **Mitigation**: Encrypt data at rest and in transit, and apply strict access controls.

#### Denial of Service (DoS)
- **Threat**: Attackers overwhelm the application, disrupting service for legitimate users.
- **Mitigation**: Implement rate limiting and web application firewalls (WAFs).

#### Elevation of Privilege
- **Threat**: Attackers gain unauthorized access to restricted data or functions.
- **Mitigation**: Regularly review access control policies and apply security patches.

### 3. Data Flow Diagrams
The DFDs visualize interactions and potential threat points.

### 4. Conclusion
The STRIDE-based threat model highlights key areas for security improvement in the SpendSmart app. Implementing recommended mitigations will protect both users and the organization from identified threats.
